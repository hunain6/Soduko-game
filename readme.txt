This C++ project is a simple and interactive Sudoku game made using the Raylib graphics library. The game displays a 9x9 Sudoku board where players can use the keyboard to fill in numbers and arrow keys to move between cells. It also includes buttons like "SOLVE", "RESTART", and "QUIT" that can be clicked with the mouse. The game checks if the entered number is correct and highlights it briefly. If the player makes three mistakes, the game shows a "GAME LOST" message. The project uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle step by step and shows the solving process visually. It also uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to check if a number already exists before highlighting. Overall, this project is a good mix of graphics, logic, and data structures like arrays and BST in a fun way.
